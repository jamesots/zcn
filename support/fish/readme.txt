This is the BSD Unix game 'fish', hacked to compile under Hitech C.
I've included an executable here as 'fish.com'. The instructions
aren't displayed by the program as with the original; instead they're
in a separate file, 'fishhelp.txt'.

This should work on any Z80-based CP/M box without modification. Given
that the executable is surprisingly large, a version in BASIC or
assembly might not be a bad idea. Both would take less space than
this, I'm sure... :-)
