QTERM V4.3e is dedicated to the memory of Irv Hoff - a programmer who was
a constant insipration while I was developing QTERM. Let us never forget
the work he did for the CP/M community.


Files included in QTERM43E.LBR:

-README.1ST	You are
QTCHAT.DYC	QTERM chat scripts documentation
QTERM.CYM	QTERM, unpatched
QTERM.DYC	QTERM documentation
QTERM.FOR	Quick description of what QTERM can do for you
QTERM.PYT	Patch information for QTERM
QT-PATCH.ZY	Patch area source, to provide a basis to work with
WHATS.NEW	Upgrade list of what's changed since V4.2g


Patch info for making QTERM work on your system is included in QTERM.PAT.
As provided, QTERM will work on a Televideo 803 (or a TPC-1), because
that's what I developed it on. Note that not all the patches are
necessary, but the more optional ones you get going, the more features
QTERM will have. QTERM.PAT also includes a reference to a "1K patch
overlay". I'm trying to collect as many of these as possible, so if you
can, try to get yours back to me, with a memo telling which computer it
works on, and which of the optional patches you have included.


The .?Y? files are made with the new LZH compression method, this typically
produces files 10 to 15 to 20 % smaller than CRUNCH. EXL.COM (in EXL.LBR)
is one tool that will decompress these, or CRLZH11.LBR is the original
.LBR for LZH compression.


For those that are interested, the name actually arose because in mid 1985
I needed a terminal program for my CP/M machine (A Televideo 803) and
put a quick 1/2K program together in under an hour. This program has been
growing ever since, but the name Q(uick) TERM(inal) program remains.


I give thanks to Dave Goodman, Tom Bopp, Larry Moore, Dave Presberg, Andy
Meyer, David Douthitt, Mitch Mitchell and Jim Bianchi for all their help
in debugging and beta testing QTERM, and to all the other people who have
sent in patches and suggestions. I'd never have got it anything like
working and as full featured without all your help.


Credit is also due the unknown author of the UNIX Kermit implementation
that I used for the basis of the Kermit code here, and to Steve Grandi
who wrote the Xmodem program in C that provided the basis for the Xmodem
code in QTERM.

A few notes:

Take a look in WHATS.NEW to see what has changed since V4.2g

QTERM V4.2 style patches will still work with QTERM V4.3e

VT100.TC got dropped since it's no longer needed - see WHATS.NEW for details

Since I've had several requests over the years to release the source, it
	has been released. Modify it if you want, but please check back
	with me before you release a version, and let me know what changes
	you made, if they're useful I may put them into the next version.
	As a side note to this, if you come across a version, and you are
	not sure if it's been modified, check with me and I can give you
	the correct CRCK values for the original V4.3e.
