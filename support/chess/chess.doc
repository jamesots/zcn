CHESS.DOC DOCUMENTATION FOR CHESS.COM
(SOURCE CODE WRITTEN IN FORTRAN)

DECEMBER 25, 1979

CHESS.COM USES ALGEBRAIC NOTATION AND A BOARD DISPLAY
SIMILAR TO MICROCHESS:

   A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H 

8  BR BN BB BQ BK BB BN BR  8
7  BP BP BP BP BP BP BP BP  7
6  -- :: -- :: -- :: -- ::  6
5  :: -- :: -- :: -- :: --  5
4  -- :: -- :: -- :: -- ::  4
3  :: -- :: -- :: -- :: --  3
2  WP WP WP WP WP WP WP WP  2
1  WR WN WB WQ WK WB WN WR  1
   A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H

THERE ARE TWO OTHER COMMANDS WHICH DISPLAY THE BOARD
AND ASK THE COMPUTER IF IT WILL ACCEPT A DRAW.  THEY
ARE "BOARD" AND "DRAW", RESPECTIVELY.

TO CASTLE KING-SIDE, TYPE IN O-O
TO CASTLE QUEEN-SIDE TYPE IN O-OO
IF YOU TRY O-O-O IT SAYS "ILLEGAL ATTEMPT TO CASTLE"

ALWAYS USE CAPITAL LETTERS, FORTRAN-CHESS DOES NOT
ACCEPT LOWER CASE.

I HAVE RUN SEVERAL GAMES COMPARING THE FORTRAN-CHESS (FC)
PROGRAM AGAINST FIDELITY ELECTRONICS' CHESS CHALLENGER 7 (CC7)
(C) 1978 FIDELITY ELECTRONICS.  WITH FC AT LEVEL 0 (IT ONLY
HAS 0 AND 1) AND CC7 AT LEVEL 1 (CC7 HAS 6 LEVELS OF PLAY)
FC WINS.  WITH FC AT LEVEL 0 AND CC7 AT LEVEL 2 CC7 WINS.
FC'S RESPONSE TIME AT LEVEL 0 VARIES BUT IS NEVER MORE THAN
90 SECONDS.  I HAVE NOT YET CLOCKED IT AT LEVEL 1, BUT
IT HAS A SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER RESPONSE TIME (AT LEAST
AS MUCH AS SEVERAL MINUTES -- ESTIMATION).

HAVE FUN!
