This is SOKOBAN.

I saw this game first on a PC running MSDOS. I found the idea of the game so
clever, that I made up my mind to make it run with an ascii terminal using
curses so that we can play it on our MicroVAX/ULTRIX. 

Along with this package there are alot of screen files describing the various
play levels. So what you need to do to install it on your own machine is:

-   Edit the header file sokoban.h to alter the given defines

You have to note the following restrictions

-   The screen files must be readable for everyone who should be able to play
    his game
-   The score file should have read/write permission only for the owner
    of the executable program. Because of that sokoban must run with setuid.

You can now compile it (just type 'make').
If compilation is succesful you must initialize the score file (just type
'sokoban -c')

There is no manual page. All you have to know when you first play the game is
the command '?'. This gives you one screenful of information.

After you have solved all the given screens (this will take a while) you will
find the game boring (sure you will). I hope there will be a lot of players who
will think out some new screens.
To test your own screens copy them to the screen directory (with a new level
number <nn>) and type sokoban -<nn>.

PLEASE DO SO AND POST NEW SCREENS TO THE NET.
OTHERWISE IT GETS BORING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Comments are welcome.
