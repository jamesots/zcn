Program:	PIPE   File Transfer Utility     PUBLIC DOMAIN
Author:		Rob Friefeld   Long Beach, CA
Purpose:	Small (1k) program intended as RAM disk resident
Usage:		pipe [du:|dir:]<afn> [du:|dir:][afn]
		i.e.  pipe <what> [where]
Assembly:	Requires Z80 machine and assembler.
Version:	1.5   2/87
Version:	1.6   8/87

Version:	1.7   10/87 
	- R/O files not handled at all in previous version
	- Frequent check for ^C to abort operation

	This utility is a fast file copier that uses full TPA buffering.
The syntax is different from pip's, i.e. the source file is named first,
then the destination.  Both source and destination may be ambiguous file
names.  (Wild card renaming of the destination can be dangerous to your
mental health, however.)  If the optional destination is omitted, files
will be fetched to the current DU:.

	If the destination file exists, you will be asked ERASE? (y/N/q).
No is the default answer.  A 'Y' will abort the copy and a 'Q' aborts the
run.

	If the destination disk is filled, the incomplete copy is deleted
and a disk reset is done.  (If this is not done, DIR will still report
0k free space.)  Otherwise, PIPE does NOT do a disk reset.


	No installation is needed.  Since most of the logic is in the DOS,
named directories under ZCPR3 will work.  Also, PIPE is reentrant.


EXAMPLES:

  B5>PIPE A0:*.Z80    (You enter...then PIPE prints...)
	Copying --> A0: FILE1   .Z80 to B5:
	Copying --> A0: FILE2   .Z80 to B5:
	Copying --> A0: ANOTHER1.Z80 to B5:

  B5>GO THIS.FIL A0:THAT.FIL
	Copying --> B5: THIS    .FIL to A0:THAT     .FIL

  A0>PIPE TEST.* ROOT:WORKS.*
	Copying --> A0: TEST    .Z80 to A15:WORKS   .Z80
	Copying --> A0: TEST    .DOC to A15:WORKS   .DOC
	Copying --> A0: TEST    .COM to A15:WORKS   .COM
