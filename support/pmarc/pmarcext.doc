PMARC

This utility creates LZH-like archives with the extension .PMA. It compresses
as effectively as the MSDOS utility LHA, but is not completely compatible (you
can read the directory with LHA on an IBM-PC, but you can't extract files from
the archive). Just type PMARC at the CP/M prompt to see a list of options.

PMEXT

This great program unpacks .PMA as well as .LZH archives (even compression
method -lh5-), and it's very fast compared to other LZH unpackers for CP/M
(like LHRD and LHX). Type PMEXT without filenames for more information.

Of course, both PMARC and PMEXT will also run under MSXDOS without any
problems, we got them via a Japanese disk-magazine for MSX.
