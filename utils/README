README for `utils' directory
----------------------------

In this directory is the source to the stock external commands for
ZCN. The .COM files - the executable commands themselves - are in
../bin. The commands are of course all optional - the system doesn't
actually *require* any of them. Details of usage are given in
`zcn.txt', in ../doc.
