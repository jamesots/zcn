Allocated blocks of memory
--------------------------

This is a registration file for allocated blocks of memory. Don't
depend on a non-relocatable (i.e. not in the source code) block of
memory without describing it here.

(This doesn't apply to using sections of the TPA from the internal
commands in internal.z. They are effectively running as external
commands, so that's not a problem.)

[Try to keep the memory listed in order!]

0000h-00ffh mostly as in CP/M (described more fully in zcn.txt)

some internal commands temporarily use parts of the TPA.

PCMCIA card memory is paged in at 4000h-7fffh when reading it.

e600h-e700h used for IM2 jump table
e700h       also used for jump table (while computer is on)
e7e7h-e7e9h jump to interrupt handler (while computer is on)
e700h-e7ffh used to store old contents of b300h-b3ffh by powrhndl.z
e800h-e87fh 128-byte keyboard buffer
e880h-e97fh 256-byte scratch area used by `find free block'
             (note that this overwrites the ccp cmdline buffer!)
e900h-e97fh 128-byte cmdline buffer used by ccp
e980h-e9ffh 128-byte card read/write buffer (needed 'cos of paging)
ea00h-eabfh internal stack used by bdos functions.
eac0h-ecffh font data (`fontdata' set to ea00h, but nowt written there)
ed00h-efffh 768-byte serial input buffer (while computer is on)
ed00h-efffh used to store old contents of b000h-b2ffh by powrhndl.z
f000h-ffffh used by screen
