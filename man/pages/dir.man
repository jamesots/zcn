NAME
	dir - show directory (list) of files

SYNOPSIS
	dir [filespec]

DESCRIPTION
	`dir' either lists the files which are on the current
	drive/user area, or the files which match the (optional) file
	specification.

BUGS
	It's very similar to CP/M's `dir' - and is therefore not very
	nice. Use `ls' instead. :-)

SEE ALSO
	ls
