NAME
	time - display current time/date

SYNOPSIS
	time

DESCRIPTION
	Displays the current time and date according to the NC100's
	real-time clock (RTC). (This can be set with `timeset'.) The
	format used is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.

	The form YYYY-MM-DD is used for the date as a) the Y/M/D order
	is the most logical, and b) I believe it conforms to ISO 8601.
