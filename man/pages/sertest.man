NAME
	sertest - simple terminal program

SYNOPSIS
	sertest

DESCRIPTION

	A simple terminal program. It just echoes serial input, and
	sends keyboard input to the serial port. (All the same,
	sertest can be useful in some circumstances.)

	You can use ^\ then q (or ^\ then ^C) to quit; ^\ then ^\
	sends a literal ^\.
