NAME
	defrag - defragment free space on drive

SYNOPSIS
	defrag [-q] d:

DESCRIPTION
	Defragments free space on the specified drive. This does not
	speed up drive operation (use `optdir' for that), but does
	mean that `sys' and `bigrun' are then sure to work (if there's
	sufficient disk space available).

OPTIONS
	-q	disable the `running commentary'

SEE ALSO
	optdir
