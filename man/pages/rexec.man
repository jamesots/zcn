NAME
	rexec - read a uuencoded file from the serial port

SYNOPSIS
	rexec filename

DESCRIPTION
	Rexec reads a uuencoded file from serial, and (when finished)
	writes it to the specified file. It also leaves a copy in
	memory at 100h, so even if no memory card is in the slot you
	can do `rexec foo' then `!!' to run a .com file.

BUGS
	It won't work (will probably crash!) if files too big to fit
	in memory are transferred (use `k3' to check available
	memory).
