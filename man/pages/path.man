NAME
	path - how external commands are found in ZCN

SYNOPSIS
	Where ZCN looks for .COM files

DESCRIPTION
	When running a COM or SUB file, ZCN tries the following
	places:

	1. Current/specified drive and current user.
	2. Current/specified drive and user 0.
	3. If no drive was specified, drive A: user 0.

	This means that user area 0 (and especially user 0 on A:, if
	you're using a card larger than 256k) is a good place to put
	programs.

SEE ALSO
	submit
