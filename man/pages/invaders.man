NAME
	invaders - (unfinished) space invaders clone

SYNOPSIS
	invaders

DESCRIPTION
	Invaders is an unfinished game. It's reasonably playable as is
	though.

KEYS
	Z	move left
	X	move right
	Space	fire
	Q	quit

BUGS
	The invaders gradually grow invisible because it starts
	updating faster than the NC100's LCD screen can handle. That's
	the main reason why I haven't bothered finishing it. :-/ But
	you should be able to get by if you crank up the intensity
	control.
