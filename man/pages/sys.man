NAME
	sys - make a drive bootable (install ZCN on it)

SYNOPSIS
	sys d:

DESCRIPTION
	Write ZCN system to a drive, making it bootable. (It's only
	useful to do this for drive A:.) It non-destructively moves
	existing drive contents up to make room if needed - if you get
	`addblk..' messages, that's what's happening.

	If you have sufficient disk space but `sys' fails, try running
	`defrag' on the drive, then try `sys' again.

SEE ALSO
	unsys, defrag
