NAME
	capsctrl - disable/enable using caps lock as control key

SYNOPSIS
	capsctrl [0|1]

DESCRIPTION
	Turn off (0) or on (1) use of caps lock as a control key
	(instead of the key labelled "Control", which then behaves
	like caps lock).

	"Function" behaves as a control key whether this is enabled or
	not.

	NB: Internal ZCN features which require use of the key
	labelled "Control" (pause output, and screen dump) need you to
	use the "Caps Lock" key instead if this is enabled.
