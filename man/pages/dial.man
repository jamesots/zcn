NAME
	dial - tone `dial' a phone number 

SYNOPSIS
	dial number

DESCRIPTION
	`dial' tone dials `number', which can consist of any of the
	characters `0123456789*#ABCD'. (A/B/C/D are extra `digits'
	available on some phones etc.)

BUGS
	The combination of the NC100's sound chip and speaker seems to
	distort the sound so much that it doesn't actually work.
