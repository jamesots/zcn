NAME
	keyb - change keyboard map

SYNOPSIS
	keyb [map_type]

DESCRIPTION
	`keyb' changes the keyboard mapping used by ZCN. It works by
	patching the currently-running ZCN, so for a non-UK mapping
	you'd normally run `keyb' from autoexec.sub.

OPTIONS
	map_type
		the mapping to use. Run `keyb' without args to see
		supported mappings.
