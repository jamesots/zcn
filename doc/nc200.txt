Using ZCN on an NC200
---------------------

The first thing to note is that you should *not* normally run the
usual `zcn.bin' on an NC200. You should run `zcn200.bin' instead. See
zcn.txt's installation guide for more on this.

Ok, with that out of the way, here's what the NC200's variant of ZCN
(zcn200.bin) supports on the '200:

- a 21-line screen;

- the memory card;

- serial and parallel ports;

- the backlight;

- the keyboard (the layout differs internally);

- turning it off :-) (this also differs).

And it *doesn't* support:

- the disk drive;

- the real-time clock;

- most graphics-using ZCN programs (they run, but the graphics don't
  appear);

- some of the ROM-using ZCN programs (the non-working ones will
  crash);

- using the extra RAM as a ramdisk (this may happen at some point, but
  only 48k of it would be available anyway).


So, at the moment, you can't run the following ROM-using programs on
an NC200:

- bbcbas and bbcmin. They crash it. For now, you're best off using the
  (freely available) generic CP/M BBC Basic from the same author,
  which you can get here:

  	http://www.rtrussell.co.uk/products/products.html

- bigrun. Likely to crash when the program exits. (It's not actually a
  ROM-using program :-), but there are similar issues at work.)

- calc. This is likely to crash.

Note that `runrom', `spell', and `spellwd' *do* work. `rrxfer' is
working for the most part, but look under the "Problems" heading in
zcn.txt's section on rrxfer for an important warning.

The graphics-using programs listed below shouldn't crash, but the
graphics won't appear:

- bs (same problem as rogue)
- dclock
- invaders
- rogue (the text is drawn `graphically', so it doesn't appear)
- ruler
- sokoban (same problem as rogue)
- slide
- zap (partial display, but it's not really usable)
- zcnbrot
- zcnclock
- zcnpaint

Note that `bmp' and `cpmtris' *do* work, as they use character-based
graphics rather than writing directly to the display memory. And
`bigv' is the first graphical program for ZCN to work correctly on
both machines, so that's ok too.

The programs listed below, while they do work, will currently only use
10 lines of the display:

- cpmtris
- dmp2txt (or rather, it only reads 10 lines of a screen dump)
- vde (the prepatched copy in the `support' dir; use vde200 instead)
- zdbe
- zselx

And finally, the following programs/commands behave differently (in a
good way :-)) on the NC200:

- light (an internal command to control the backlight) only exists on
  the NC200.

- man uses 21 lines.

- more uses 21 lines.

- vde200 (in the `support' dir) is a prepatched copy of vde, altered
  to use 21 lines rather than 10.
