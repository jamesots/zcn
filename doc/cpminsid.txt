About the `cp/m inside' logo
----------------------------

Both versions of the logo included here, `cpminsid.gif' and
`cpminsid.ps', are public domain. You can do anything you want with
them. Feel free to distribute copies of the logo anywhere you want.

As an example of a good use for the logo, I have a small (about
20x15mm) printout of the logo stuck on my NC100, over Amstrad's stupid
`user friendly' logo. Seems appropriate somehow. :-)
