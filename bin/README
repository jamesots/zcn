README for `bin' directory
----------------------------

This directory contains almost all the programs which make up ZCN -
`zcn.bin' which is the operating system itself, `rrinit.bin' which
runs under the ROM s/w and makes an initial `runrom.ram' snapshot
file, and various .COM files which run under ZCN.

(Note that some of the less useful programs have been moved to the
`extra' subdirectory.)

See `zcn.txt' in ../doc for details of how to transfer these, how to
use them, etc.

Also, see the README in ../support, which describes the many other
included programs you can run on ZCN.
