README for `bin/extra' directory
--------------------------------

This directory contains a few of the less useful .COM files which come
with ZCN. (They were moved here so that the `bin' dir wouldn't contain
too much to fit on a single bootable ZCN drive along with things like
qterm and vde.)

See `zcn.txt' in ../../doc for details of how to transfer these, how
to use them, etc.
