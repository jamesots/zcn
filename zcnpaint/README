Zcnpaint is a paint program. You need a microsoft-compatible serial
mouse (plugged in the 9-pin serial port) to use it. I use a Logitech
Pilot Trackball, and haven't tried it with any other mice. It should
work with just about anything, though.

Zcnpaint is documented in doc/zcn.txt. Look in the "ZCN external
commands" section under "ZCNPAINT".

This directory contains source only; the binary is in the 'bin'
directory.
